Just commit messages for now

Adding all current files from simple_simpsons v.1, readme and git ignore.
V.1 contains title, start button, level counter, simon squares, a modal game over alert, and a huge HTML background not created by myself, but looks really cool.  game HTML, CSS, and JS additions all on the same page, considering splitting them up into separate files for organizational sake.  Also added comments on most functions, but still cumbersome to explain

Current Issues:
1)  playerPattern is sending its items back to pattern in the wrong order.
2) After game over, clicking start button activates game over alert again, and will not restart the game

Future additions: working game,  audio on start click and square click, and game over.  Switching images for the flash instead of animation flash.

Added the HTML files, and all the CSS and JS files(underneath CSS folder,need to fix).

Includes images, audio and font files used or planned to be used.  images include initial simpsons images, flash images, and game over image,
